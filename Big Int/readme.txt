This was the main project for Umass Lowell's computing 3 course, which was broken up into smaller sub goals. The purpose of this project was to create a class that acted like the standard C++ integer, but able to hold much larger values, while also being compatible with the standard operations used on integers. The big int is represented internally as a string, and the mathematical operations and had to be rewritten from scratch. Division was the final operation to be finnished and aso was the most challenging, I had it mostly functional, but it seems to break in certain cases which I have not fixed. The main C++ features used to complete this project include overloading the C++ integer operators.
